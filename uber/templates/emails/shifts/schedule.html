Sorry for the mix-up, but due to a timezone bug, all of the shift times in the previous email were 5 hours off from their actual times.  Please disregard that email, as this email has the correct times.
<br/> <br/>

{% if attendee.takes_shifts and attendee.shifts %}
    The schedule of shifts you've signed up for is below; please print it out so that you can have your department managers
    mark each shift as worked.
    <br/> <br/>
    If you forget to print out this sheet and would like to pick up a spare copy, or if you want to change your hours,
    you can drop by Staffing Ops in the Fest Ops room during {{ EVENT_NAME }}.
