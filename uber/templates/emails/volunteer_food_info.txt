{{ attendee.first_name }},

Thanks again for volunteering at {{ EVENT_NAME }} this year. We feed our volunteers three meals per day during {{ EVENT_NAME }}, so you can drop by the Hospitality Suite in Retreat I & II* located on the 3rd floor of the Retreat building for food during any of the following times:

Breakfast: 8am to 11am
Lunch: 1pm to 4pm
Dinner: 6pm to 10pm
Overnight: 10pm to 5am

{% if attendee.badge_type == ATTENDEE_BADGE %}You'll become eligible for food after working your first shift. Please come to Staffing Ops (in the Fest Ops room) after you first get your badge to get your shift schedule, and then come back to get your ribbon marked after working your first shift and getting your department head to sign your sheet.

{% endif %}The first meal served will be a light breakfast on Friday, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon. More information can be found by visiting http://magsuite.jennytru.com

Please let us know if you have any questions.
